### Assignment 1

Task 1 and 2 will work as expected. Type in the command box:  
`python3 fsmd-sim.py [integer] test_2/gcd_desc.xml test_2/gcd_stim.xml`

Task 3 is a 8 BIT integer to binary converter. In order to run it, type in the command box:  
`python3 fsmd-sim.py [integer] gcd_desc3.xml gcd_stim3.xml`

Thanks!
